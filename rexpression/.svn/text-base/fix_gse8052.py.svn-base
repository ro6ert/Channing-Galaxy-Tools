This is long because all the data are here in the script - for posterity.
GEOquery fun - added combine(eset1,eset2) to get gse8052 but the
pheno data is brutally ugly
we need to extract something more useful for ggtools
a list of rs to be turned into a map file and a ped file

119 or so rs  we get from the phenodata.
Using the ucsc table browser we get this the makings of a .map file - code below writes it out
as a proper map file. The phenodata shown below is as it appears from GEO via getGEO.

This could I guess be automated if that's how we're going to be getting genotypes as geo phenotypes.

Ugh.
