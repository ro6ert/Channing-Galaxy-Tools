**Syntax**

- **Input file** should have columns chr start end sequence
- **Outfile History name** will be a new interval file in your history with the CG count appended to each sequence input 

**Internals**

This is a simple tool that appends the count of CG dinucleotides in each sequence to an interval
file containing sequences as the fourth column

**Attribution**

Antony Kaspi wanted a GC counter in Galaxy, so he wrote a perl on liner and proposed the tool.

Ross Lazarus tried really hard to like perl but finally ran screaming
back to the re module for the first working version as a short python script.

a boatload of other people's work like linux, python perl, and such without which 
none of this stuff would work.
