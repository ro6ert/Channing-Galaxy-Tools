**Purpose**

    EstimateLibraryComplexity
    Attempts to estimate library complexity from sequence alone. 
    Does so by sorting all reads by the first N bases (5 by default) of each read and then 
    comparing reads with the first N bases identical to each other for duplicates. Reads are considered to be 
    duplicates if they match each other with no gaps and an overall mismatch rate less than or equal to MAX_DIFF_RATE (0.03 by default).

    Reads of poor quality are filtered out so as to provide a more accurate estimate. 
    The filtering removes reads with any no-calls in the first N bases or with a mean base quality lower than 
    MIN_MEAN_QUALITY across either the first or second read.

    The algorithm attempts to detect optical duplicates separately from PCR duplicates and excludes these in the 
    calculation of library size. Also, since there is no alignment to screen out technical reads one 
    further filter is applied on the data. After examining all reads a histogram is built of 
    [#reads in duplicate set -> #of duplicate sets]; 
    all bins that contain exactly one duplicate set are then removed from the histogram as outliers before library size is estimated.

**Why you might want to use this tool**

    This tool provides a Galaxy interface to one of the Picard tools.
    If you need to estimate library complexity from sequences, the Picard tool may help.


**Note on the Regular Expression**

    (from the Picard docs)
    This tool requires a valid regular expression to parse out the read names in the incoming SAM or BAM file. 
    These values are used to estimate the rate of optical duplication in order to give a more accurate estimated library size. 
    The regular expression should contain three capture groups for the three variables, in order. 
    Default value: [a-zA-Z0-9]+:[0-9]:([0-9]+):([0-9]+):([0-9]+).*.

    Option	Description
    "INPUT=File","One or more files to combine and estimate library complexity from. Reads can be mapped or unmapped. This option may be specified 0 or more times."
    "OUTPUT=File","Output file to writes per-library metrics to. Required."
    "MIN_IDENTICAL_BASES=Integer","The minimum number of bases at the starts of reads that must be identical for reads to be grouped together for duplicate detection. In effect total_reads / 4^max_id_bases reads will be compared at a time, so lower numbers will produce more accurate results but consume exponentially more memory and CPU. Default value: 5."
    "MAX_DIFF_RATE=Double","The maximum rate of differences between two reads to call them identical. Default value: 0.03. "
    "MIN_MEAN_QUALITY=Integer","The minimum mean quality of the bases in a read pair for the read to be analyzed. Reads with lower average quality are filtered out and not considered in any calculations. Default value: 20."
    "READ_NAME_REGEX=String","Regular expression that can be used to parse read names in the incoming SAM file. Read names are parsed to extract three variables: tile/region, x coordinate and y coordinate. These values are used to estimate the rate of optical duplication in order to give a more accurate estimated library size. The regular expression should contain three capture groups for the three variables, in order. Default value: [a-zA-Z0-9]+:[0-9]:([0-9]+):([0-9]+):([0-9]+).*. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value."
    "OPTICAL_DUPLICATE_PIXEL_DISTANCE=Integer","The maximum offset between two duplicte clusters in order to consider them optical duplicates. This should usually be set to some fairly small number (e.g. 5-10 pixels) unless using later versions of the Illumina pipeline that multiply pixel values by 10, in which case 50-100 is more normal. Default value: 100"
    "CREATE_MD5_FILE=Boolean","Whether to create an MD5 digest for any BAM files created. Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. "

This tool wraps Picard and is supported through the galaxy-bugs mailing list
or by providing comments through the report form that appears automatically
if a tool fails unexpectedly when you run it in Galaxy.

Here, you can apply Picard tools through Galaxy which might be easier than through the native Picard command line interface.
