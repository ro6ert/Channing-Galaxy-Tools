# Galaxy is configured by default to be useable in a single-user development
# environment.  To tune the application for a multi-user production
# environment, see the documentation at:
#
# http://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-central/wiki/Config/ProductionServer
#

# Throughout this sample configuration file, except where stated otherwise,
# uncommented values override the default if left unset, whereas commented
# values are set to the default value.
# examples of many of these options are explained in more detail in the wiki:
#
# Config hackers are encouraged to check there before asking for help.

# ---- HTTP Server ----------------------------------------------------------

# Configuration of the internal HTTP server.

# The internal HTTP server to use.  Currently only Paste is provided.  This
# option is required.
use = egg:Paste#http

# The port on which to listen.

# request.

# ---- Filters --------------------------------------------------------------

# Filters sit between Galaxy and the HTTP server.

# These filters are disabled by default.  They can be enabled with
# 'filter-with' in the [app:main] section below.

# to decrease the size of data transferred over the network.  If using a proxy
# server, please enable gzip compression there instead.
#filter-with = gzip

# If running behind a proxy server and Galaxy is served from a subdirectory,
# enable the proxy-prefix filter and set the prefix in the
# [filter:proxy-prefix] section above.
#filter-with = proxy-prefix

# If proxy-prefix is enabled and you're running more than one Galaxy instance
# behind one hostname, you will want to set this to the same path as the prefix
# in the filter above.  This value becomes the "path" attribute set in the
# cookie so the cookies from each instance will not clobber each other.
#cookie_path = None

# -- Database

# By default, Galaxy uses a SQLite database at 'database/universe.sqlite'.  You
# may use a SQLAlchemy connection string to specify an external database
# instead.  This string takes many options which are explained in detail in the
# config file documentation.

# -- Mail and notification

# Galaxy sends mail for various things: Subscribing users to the mailing list
