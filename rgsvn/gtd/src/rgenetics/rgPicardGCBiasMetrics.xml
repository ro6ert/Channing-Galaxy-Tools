**Syntax**

- **Input** is sam/bam format aligned short read data in your current history
- **Title** is the title to use for all output files from this job - use it for high level metadata
- **Refseq** is the sequence you want to interogate - eg hg19 - can be Galaxy built-in or a special one from your history
- **Window Size** see Picard documentation http://picard.sourceforge.net/command-line-overview.shtml#CollectGCBiasMetrics
- **Minimum Genome Fraction** See Picard documentation at http://picard.sourceforge.net/command-line-overview.shtml#CollectGCBiasMetrics

**Summary**

This Galaxy tool uses Picard to report measures of GC bias.
Picard is supported through the SamTools project.
This tool wraps Picard and is supported through the galaxy-bugs mailing list
or by providing comments through the report form that appears automatically
if a tool fails unexpectedly when you run it in Galaxy.

All the Picard tools are freely available and are documented
at http://picard.sourceforge.net/command-line-overview.shtml#CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics

**Picard Documentation**

The Picard documentation (reformatted for Galaxy) says:

.. csv-table:: GC Bias Doc
   :header-rows: 1

  Option,Description
  "REFERENCE_SEQUENCE=File","The reference sequence fasta file. Required."
  "INPUT=File","The BAM or SAM file containing aligned reads. Required."
  "OUTPUT=File","The text file to write the metrics table to. Required."
  "CHART_OUTPUT=File","The PDF file to render the chart to. Required."
  "SUMMARY_OUTPUT=File","The text file to write summary metrics to. Default value: null."
  "WINDOW_SIZE=Integer","The size of windows on the genome that are used to bin reads. Default value: 100."
  "MINIMUM_GENOME_FRACTION=Double","For summary metrics, exclude GC windows that include less than this fraction of the genome. Default value: 1.0E-5."
  "CREATE_MD5_FILE=Boolean","Whether to create an MD5 digest for any BAM files created. Default value: false."


GcBiasDetailMetrics

 Class that holds detailed metrics about reads that fall within windows of a certain GC bin on the reference genome.

Output Column Definitions

#. GC: The G+C content of the reference sequence represented by this bin. Values are from 0% to 100%
#. WINDOWS: The number of windows on the reference genome that have this G+C content.
#. READ_STARTS: The number of reads who's start position is at the start of a window of this GC.
#. MEAN_BASE_QUALITY: The mean quality (determined via the error rate) of all bases of all reads that are assigned to windows of this GC.
#. NORMALIZED_COVERAGE: The ration of "coverage" in this GC bin vs. the mean coverage of all GC bins. A number of 1 represents mean coverage, a number less than one represents lower than mean coverage (e.g. 0.5 means half as much coverage as average) while a number greater than one represents higher than mean coverage (e.g. 3.1 means this GC bin has 3.1 times more reads per window than average).
#. ERROR_BAR_WIDTH: The radius of error bars in this bin based on the number of observations made. For example if the normalized coverage is 0.75 and the error bar width is 0.1 then the error bars would be drawn from 0.65 to 0.85.

**Typical tool invocation without Galaxy is on a command line - eg:**

java -jar /share/shared/galaxy/tool-data/shared/jars/CollectGcBiasMetrics.jar REFERENCE_SEQUENCE="hg18.fasta"
MINIMUM_GENOME_FRACTION=0.00001 INPUT=test.bam OUTPUT=picardASMetrics.txt OUTPUT=test.txt CHART_OUTPUT=test.pdf
WINDOW_SIZE=100 VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT

Note that last parameter - your life will be far easier if you use it.
Unfortunately some packages seem perfectly capable of producing sam and bam
files that Picard will be picky about otherwise.
There is a clean sam tool - but only filters what it ignores. The lenient
flag allows reads to be discarded if they're empty or don't map.
This seems an awful strategy but unfortunately may be needed to run an analysis
using badly behaved external packages.

**Why you might want to use this tool**

This tool provides a Galaxy interface to one of the Picard tools.
If you want some measures of GC bias compared to an organism reference sequence, the Picard tool may help.

**Attributions**

Picard and Samtools go together.
They are external to and completely independent of Galaxy. We acknowledge that all credit for
their methods and contribution are due to them.

Here, you can apply Picard tools through Galaxy which might be easier than through the native Picard command line interface.
