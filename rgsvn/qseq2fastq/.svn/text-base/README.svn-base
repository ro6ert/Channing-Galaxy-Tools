Analyzing next-generation sequencing data: Convert from qseq to fastqsanger

HISTORY

This tool was uploaded to the community site at http://community.g2.bx.psu.edu by
Vipin T Sreedharan as version 0.1

Ross Lazarus added a simple Galaxy functional test, some additional
documentation in the help section and changed the input data format to interval because this is 
what the current sniffers will determine as the datatype of any uploaded qseq files if 'autodetect' is
used (which is how most users are likely to do it!)

This is likely to be added to the default distribution if there's enough interest.
Until then, you may need to move the test files (qseq_test.*) into your tool-data directory
so galaxy can find them, and put qseq2fastq.pl and qseq2fastq.xml somewhere in your tools - eg under
a new directory called qseq2fastq

Then, you need to tell Galaxy where the xml file is by adding a line in your local tool_conf.xml and restart so the tool
shows up in your tool panel

You'll also need to adjust tool_conf.xml.sample if you want to run the functional tests eg as:
sh run_functional_tests -id qseq2fastq
from your Galaxy root, which should run this tool's test only 
if you want to make sure it's all working right.

AFAIK the output is already groomed so is set to fastqsanger - but I honestly don't know if Illumina
output files of this format are always so clean - if anyone knows, please let me (or Vipin) know
on the galaxy-dev list so we can make that clear for the next version

CONTENTS

qseq2fastq.xml: Tool configuration file.

qseq2fastq.pl: The file converter program written in PERL.

qseq_test.txt: A small qseq file for testing -> [your galaxy root]/test-data/

qseq_test.fasta: Output fastqsanger file for testing -> [your galaxy root]/test-data/

LICENSE

Vipin's original did not mention a license, 
so to keep things 'simple', 
I'll add the same license as the Galaxy distribution to all the materials provided in
this source distribution as at October 2010 unless
there's some objection...
